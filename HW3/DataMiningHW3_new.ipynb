The template of the class is given. The init function of the class takes as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y. The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 15 epochs, using learning rates: [0, .0001, .001, .01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and regularization (ridge regression) constants: [0,10,100] . Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch (for 15 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for SGD. (2pts) Report the MSE at the end of 15 epochs for the two best combinations.\n"
